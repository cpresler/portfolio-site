# A Bit About Me



> Passionate about user-centered design, building scalable applications, and continuously learning and mentoring others.

I'm a designer by formal education and a front-end engineer and user experience specialist by professional experience. I have been designing, building, and scaling software applications in a variety of contexts and industries for more than 8 years and I am just as passionate about building high quality experiences today as the day I started.

### How did I get here?

Naturally curious about how the world is built and how humans interact with it lead me to study art and design at Washington University in St. Louis which honed my creative analytical skills and introduced me to design thinking - the tech world tends to call this rapid, iterative problem solving. Interested in web design, I needed to understand how to build what I was designing for. I dove into to development and fell in love with complex problem solving involved in creating the best solution possible - one that optimizes user experience, technical performance, and business goals. 

My passion for understanding the problems we are solving, as well as who we are solving them for, has been a hallmark of my work along with being an avid collaborator. I have worked on a lot of different types of projects Web3, e-commerce, and enterprise software. In each context I have sought to distinguish myself by taking the time to understand three things: 
  1. what problems are we solving?
  2. who are our users?
  3. what is the existing system, and how can we make it better?

I have worked on both sides of the Designer | Developer divide and in every role I have worked to bridge the knowledge and language gap between the two to help them collaborate as effectively as possible. As a result, I'm passionate about multi-functional teams, and collaborative technologies that make working on a team produce results bigger than the sum of its individual contributors. Pivoting to working fully remotely, this passion has become key in helping remote teams build rapport and collaborate effectively.

### When I'm not working?

Designing and building is pretty much the fabric of who I am, but outside of work I find balance in creating things with my hands using a variety of materials, including food. I wouldn't really consider myself a foodie, but I enjoy exploring the world through food, and am always open to new restaurant suggestions! 

I love spending time with my family, and being outside. In 2013 I hiked entire Appalachian Trail end-to-end. It was a huge learning and growth experience. These days I generally keep it to short trips, but the [Pacific Crest Trail](https://www.fs.usda.gov/pct/) and the [Te Araroa Trail](https://www.teararoa.org.nz/) are both on my bucket list.
